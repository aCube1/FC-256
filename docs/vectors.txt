======== IRQ's, Exceptions and System Vectors ========
When a interrupt is requested, the CPU does the following steps:
- (IRQ/NMI) Wait instruction finishes executing.
- (IRQ) Checks if I flag is set, otherwise continue the IRQ.
- (Illegal Instruction) Increment PC by 2.
- (Illegal Address) Set Last Byte from Program Counter to 0x00.
- Pushes the Low Word of Program Counter into the Stack.
- Pushes the High Word of Program Counter into the Stack.
- Pushes the Program Status into the Stack.
- (IRQ/NMI) Set I flag to prevent interruption of current Interrupt Request.
- Read High PC from Vector Address, but set the High Byte to 0x00.
- Read Low PC from Vector Address.


==== 0x00-e3: Unused ====
- Currently unused. Users should not use this address range.
- It's recommended to fill this memory area with 0xff.


==== 0xe4-e7: Illegal Address
- Triggered when an attempt to access a address larger than 24-bits. Is only
triggered when the user set the Last Byte from the Program Count or
Stack Pointer.
- When triggered, the current Program Counter and Program Status are pushed
into the Stack. Before pushing into the Stack, the Program Counter Last Byte is
set to 0x00.
- Takes 6 cycles to complete.


==== 0xe8-eb: Illegal Instruction ====
- Triggered when a undocumented/illegal instruction is executed.
- When triggered, increment Program Counter by 2, push Program Counter and
Program Status into the Stack.
- Takes 6 cycles to complete.


==== 0xec-ef: Division by Zero ====
- Triggered by DIV and DVS instructions when an attempt of Division by
Zero is performed.
- When triggered, the current Program Counter and Program Status are pushed
into the Stack.
- Takes 5 cycles to complete.


==== 0xf0-f3: Hardware NMI ====
- Triggered by a Hardware Request.
- When triggered, the current, Program Counter and Program Status are pushed
into the Stack and the Flag I is set to prevent more Requests.
- Takes 7 cycles to complete.


==== 0xf4-f7: Hardware IRQ ====
- Triggered by a Hardware Request, and can be ignored if the Flag I of
Program Status is set.
- When triggered, the current Program Counter and Program Status are pushed
into the Stack and the Flag I is set to prevent more Requests.
- Takes 8 cycles to complete.


==== 0xf8-fb: Reset ====
- Triggered when the CPU hard/soft reset or startup.
- When triggered, just set the Program Counter to the Vector
Address.


==== 0xfc-ff: Stack Address  ====
- Contains the default stack address at the cpu reset.
