======== IRQ's, Exceptions and System Vectors ========
When a interrupt is requested, the CPU does the following steps:
- (IRQ/NMI) Wait instruction finishes executing.
- (IRQ) Checks if I flag is set, otherwise continue the IRQ.
- (Illegal Instruction) Increment PC by 2.
- Pushes the Program Bank into the Stack.
- Pushes the Program Counter into the Stack.
- Pushes the Program Status into the Stack.
- (IRQ/NMI) Set I flag to prevent interruption of current Interrupt Request.
- Read PB from Vector Address, but throw the last byte to 0x00.
- Read PC from Vector Address.


==== 0xff-fc: Stack Address  ====
- Contains the default stack address at the cpu reset.


==== 0xfb-f8: Reset ====
- Triggered when the CPU hard/soft reset or startup.
- When triggered, just set the Program Bank and Program counter to the Vector
Address.


==== 0xf7-f4: Hardware IRQ ====
- Triggered by a Hardware Request, and can be ignored if the Flag I of
Program Status is set.
- When triggered, the current Program Bank, Program Counter and Program Status
are pushed into the Stack and the Flag I is set to prevent more Requests.
- Takes 6 cycles to complete.


==== 0xf3-f0: Hardware NMI ====
- Triggered by a Hardware Request.
- When triggered, the current Program Bank, Program Counter and Program Status
are pushed into the Stack and the Flag I is set to prevent more Requests.
- Takes 6 cycles to complete.


==== 0xef-ec: Division by Zero ====
- Triggered by DIV and DVS instructions when an attempt of Division by
Zero is performed.
- When triggered, the current Program Bank, Program Counter and Program Status
are pushed into the Stack.
- Takes 5 cycles to complete.


==== 0xeb-e8: Illegal Instruction ====
- Triggered when a undocumented/illegal instruction is executed.
- When triggered, the current Program Bank, Program Counter and Program Status
are pushed into the Stack.
- Takes 6 cycles to complete.


==== 0xe7-00: Unused ====
- Currently unused. Users should not use this address range.
- It's recommended to fill this memory area with 0xff.
