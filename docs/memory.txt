Virtual FC-256 Memory Layout

Memory:
* The CPU has (virtually) a 24-bit address bus, which allow 16MiB of
addressable memory.
* When addressing an 24-bit memory address, the CPU will store the first byte
on the DB register.
Example: MOV rX, (0x246942)
- The CPU will store the extra byte(0x24) on the DB register, access
the address 0x6942 on Bank 0x24 and store the data on the rX register.
